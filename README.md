# Flutter E-commerce Admin Panel - Clean Architecture

The **Flutter E-commerce Admin Panel** is a web-based application built using Flutter to manage and oversee the operations of an eCommerce platform. It allows admins to manage products, categories, orders, and users. The panel connects to a Firebase backend for real-time data management and synchronization, providing an efficient interface for business management.

### CONFIGURATIONS & SETUPS
* New project setup with feature-first folder structure.
* Integrated Git for version control and connected the project to GitHub. 
* configure admin_panel_app to use the same Firebase data as ecommerce_app
* Add Helper functions, utilities, and constants - code reusability.

### ROUTING IN FLUTTER WEB
* Understanding basics, navigation & Data passing
* Handling the # from the Flutter Web URLs
* Redirect an unlogged-in user to the login page - GetMiddleware

### RESPONSIVE & ADAPTIVE DESIGN
* Create responsive and adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet and mobile.
* Create adaptive appbar for desktop, tablet and mobile.
* Create responsive sidebar - Handle Browser Back and Forward Buttons.

### ADMIN MANAGEMENT
* Design Responsive Login Screen
* Design Forget Password & Reset Password Screens
*

## TESTING FEATURES
* 

## CI/CD FEATURES
* Hide Generated Files on Android Studio or VSCode

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building the admin panel (web-focused).
* **Dart**: Programming language used for building the app.
* **Firebase**: Backend services including authentication, Firestore (real-time database), and Firebase hosting.
* **GetX**: State management for maintaining app-wide state (authentication, products, orders, etc.).

## REQUIREMENTS
* **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.0+.
* **Android Studio or Visual Studio Code**: Code editors with Flutter and Dart extensions.
* **Firebase Account**: For managing authentication and database operations.

## INSTALLATION
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/drogbut/flutter_ecommerce_admin_panel.git
    cd flutter_ecommerce_admin_panel
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3. **Configure Firebase**:
    * Create a Firebase project and configure Firestore and authentication.
4. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
5. Auto generate files
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
or watch command in order to keep the source code synced automatically:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

6. Hide Generated Files
In-order to hide generated files, navigate to `Android Studio` -> `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `File Types` and paste the below lines under `ignore files and folders` section:
```bash
*.inject.summary;*.inject.dart;*.g.dart;
```
In Visual Studio Code, navigate to `Preferences` -> `Settings` and search for `Files:Exclude`. Add the following patterns:
```bash
**/*.inject.summary
**/*.inject.dart
**/*.g.dart
```
